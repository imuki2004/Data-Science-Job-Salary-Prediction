# Data-Science-Job-Salary-Prediction
Data from data science job posts from the website Glassdoor is collected. Several modules were conducted to explore the dataset, visualize the data, perform dimension reduction, and apply classification methods for prediction. This project uses different classification methods to predict whether the salary is high or not and compare the accuracy of each method.
